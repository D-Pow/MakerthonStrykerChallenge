# Stryker Challenge

The goal of this project was to design a unified, dynamic system
that would facilitate information flow and communication in an
operating room (OR). This system would incorporate the physician's
preference card (showing tools needed and necessary orientation of
objects in the room), the patient's medical information (including
allergies and medical conditions), a room layout diagram, and the
ability to verify that the information present is correct before
the elective surgery begins.

The design would include views for surgeons, anesthesiologists, and
their residents to make changes to utensils, room layout, and 
medicines included. A separate view (that hides personal details,
e.g. patient information) would be available for use in the Sterile
Processing Department (SPD) to collect the needed tools and for
the nurses to use to organize the OR for the team.

The ultimate result of this project would be to unify patient health
records, the physician's preference card, and room layout in a 
single, dynamic system that is always up-to-date. This way, less time
is spent preparing OR rooms and less foot traffic is needed to obtain
extra tools that weren't requested in the room preparation. This would
save billions of dollars in OR room costs, reduce the risk of infection
of the patient, reduce the time needed to keep the patient under
anesthesia, and improve OR efficiency overall.

This system would ideally integrate with all current Stryker systems
for one unified system.
